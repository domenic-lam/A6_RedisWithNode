/* Query1: (20pts) How many tweets are there? Create a tweetCount key that contains the total number of
 tweets in the database. For this, initialize tweetCount in 0 (SET), then query the tweets collection in 
 Mongo and increase (INCR) tweetCount. Once the query is done, get the last value of tweetCount (GET) 
 and print it in the console with a message that says "There were ### tweets", with ### being the actual 
 number
