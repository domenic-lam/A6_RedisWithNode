# Assignment 6: Use Redis With Node
 In this assignment you will be using Node to interact with an in-memory Redis Database. For this we will be building on the Mongo Database you used for Assignment 5.

In this assignment you will be using Node to query and modify a Mongo Document Database.

## To import the file using mongoimport:

2. `npm start`

To run queries 1-4 individually:

1. `npm install`
2. `node ./query1`
3. `node ./query2`
4. `node ./query3`
5. `node ./query4`
